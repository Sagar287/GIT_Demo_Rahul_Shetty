		// most important tool, no matter development or testing
		// a continous integration tool
		// suppose you have 50tc to be executed, you can do it with testng
		// with the help of xml file in testng , or cmd command in maven
		// but that is manual work only
		// if we want to schedule are tc to be executed at 3AM so that we get result
		// by 10am morning, we create a job,
		// because if business wants to see result, they will not open eclipse 
		// jenkins helps in balancing version compatability issues
		
		// rahul shetty video - 158
		// install Jenkins
		// go to google, search jenkins download and click on 'Generic Java package(.war)'
		// you need to check path for jenkins and then run cmd command
		// 'java -jar 7.jenkins.war -httpPort=9090'
		// jenkins will promt for id and password for first time
		// but my login is not happening
		// maven has a good integration with CI tools like Jenkins
